# matspec
matlab code from spectro preprocessing

_siemens dicom spectro read into matlab

_simple spectra preprocessing for single spectra acquisition (and also MEGA press): 
phase/frequency correction before summing 

_ plot functions

_ lcmodel preparation of .CONTROL file

_ lcmodel results read to write csv output files

Unfurtunatly this is still a poorly documented code ...
